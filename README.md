# Kisma – We Are

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
We are free to decide
we will love and let love
We are free to believe
we will love and let love
I saw her standing
in the street alone
Her head was down
face locked onto the phone
And I wished I had her number so
I could be, "Caller Unknown"
And then I tell her
"Look into my eyes
and never let it go"
We are free to decide
we will love and let love
We are free to believe
we will love and let love
Love and let love
(love and let love)
Love and let love
(love and let love)
We are free to decide
we will love and let love
We are free to believe
we will love and let love
Don't let it go
or we never might find it again
Don't let it go
'cause we never might
find it again'
As I was about to open
her the door
I saw the guy
that she was waiting for
He had no flowers in his hands
and no time to say,
"Hello"
If I were in his place
I know I would ve
kissed her slow
We are free to decide
we will love and let love
We are free to believe
we will love and let love
Love and let love
(love and let love)
Love and let love
(love and let love)
We are free to decide
we will love and let love
We are free to believe
we will love and let love
Don't let it go
or we never might find it again
Don't let it go
'cause we never might
find it again'
